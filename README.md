Tools for automatically retrieving files from Konica copiers/scanners

## What is this?

Konica has a pretty good interface for scanning in files in their copiers (business
machines, etc.) but a pretty poor interface for retrieving them afterwards,
and, as far as I can tell, no public APIs for doing so.

This script uses Selenium to automatically download everything
in a Konica box.

From 2006–2024 I was professor of music at MIT and before that I
was in Boston at Harvard for another 12 years.  This meant I had a LOT
of files etc. stored up.  In Spring 2023, I scanned every paper file I owned
(30 min a night x 120 days) and this script made it possible to do
it quickly and cheaply (scanning services wanted $30,000!)  Now I'm
happily supporting my wife's career as a profeessor at U. of Hawai'i,
but have all of my notes conveniently scanned.  :-)


## It's broken?

This was a one-time script.  If you're using it and modifying it,
let me know and I'll add you as a maintainer.  I don't have access
to a Konica scanner anymore, so I have no idea if this still works.
